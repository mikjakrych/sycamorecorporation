          In the spring of 1890, <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#allenmason"><span class="link">Allen C. Mason</span></a> of Tacoma built The Mason Block, now known as Sycamore Square. This three-story brick building with a mezzanine, cost $50,000.00 to construct. Mr. Mason advertised extensively in eastern newspapers to attract investors; his glowing ads brought millions of dollars to the northwest. Mr. Mason attended to every detail from land selection to the landscaping of the completed project. He developed them with prudence, financial strength, sound marketing and unwavering integrity. He was a true visionary. Like many other buildings in the area, it was designed as an office building with residential on the top floor and commercial space on the ground floor. It is now the oldest building in Fairhaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the original tenants of the Mason Block were the Pacific Clothing Company whose painted sign can still be seen at the northeastern corner of the building, Higginson & Hardy Pharmacy-now known as the Fairhaven Pharmacy-which was located on the northwestern corner, and the Great Northern Express offices on 12th street in the southwestern corner of the building. Joseph A. Blakely, the town marshal of Fairhaven was one of the residents of the building along with S. E. Mullin, who had a Real Estate office on the same floor.

        <p>
          Allen C. Mason, the builder of the Mason Block was born in Rhode Island in 1834 and was named after Captain Allen Chase of the Atlantic Trade- a friend of the family. Captain Chase had spent his life at sea and had no progeny to carry on his good name so he made an offer to deposit an account of $1,000 on his 18th birthday if the Mason’s named their son after him.
        </P>
        <p>
          Over the years, Allen C. Mason worked hard and became very successful. Upon receiving $1,000 on his 18th birthday, Allen was able to complete his education and invested the remainder in real estate, becoming one of the founders of Polo, Illinois, a town whose main street still bears his name.
        </P>
        <p>
          Allen attended Wesleyan University and graduated at the age of twenty. Soon after, he became a teacher and eventually served as principal of different high schools in Illinois. Furthermore, during this time he wrote two books, Mason’s Problems in Arithmetic, and another that focused on his teaching profession. Aside from teaching and writing, Allen studied law and was even admitted to the bar.
        </P>
        <p>
          Allen moved West in May 1883 with his family and rented a modest cottage in Tacoma.
          Shortly after their move, Allen found a job with a real estate firm and nearly doubled the family wealth, becoming a multi-millionaire by 1890 and owning enterprises such as Olympia’s gas plant and electrical powerhouse, Tacoma’s Shore Line Railroad, the Tacoma Daily News and, with Nelson Bennett, the Tacoma streetcar system.
        </P>
        <p>
          Not only did he build the Mason Block in Fairhaven, he built one in Tacoma and owned the
          Mason Opera House in Yakima, where he also provided the funds to irrigate 6,000 acres of orchard land. Allen was a major stockholder in the Tacoma Theater Building and Tacoma Smelter and sat on the board of directors of Bellingham Bay National Bank, the Tacoma National Bank and the First National Bank of North Yakima.
        </P>
        <p>
          Extremely successful and hard working, it is not surprising he built something as incredible
          as the Mason Block, now known as the Sycamore Square building.
        </P>
        <p>
          "…nothing astonishes me on Puget Sound. If such a thing were possible, I would be surprised at the wonderful growth and improvement of this place. The more I see of it, the better I am pleased and I find much satisfaction in my interests here…Fairhaven is now assured a big success on Puget Sound…" -Allen C. Mason, 1890
